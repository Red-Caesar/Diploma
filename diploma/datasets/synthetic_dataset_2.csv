"What is the significance of thematic investing at Schroders, and how has it impacted their product range?","Thematic investing is central to Schroders' strategy for growing and evolving their core equities and bonds business. They have expanded their thematics range in response to growing evidence that investors want to back trends they believe in. This expansion has led to a diverse offering that includes broad themes like disruption and specialized areas such as food and water, digital infrastructure, or smart manufacturing. The Global Energy Transition strategy, in particular, has seen strong demand and the largest net inflow among thematic strategies in 2022.","As early as 2007, we were able to offer our clients access to a Climate Change fund. However, six years ago we took a conscious decision to develop a broader thematics range. The evidence was growing that investors increasingly wanted to be able to back the trends they believe in. It was therefore put at the heart of the strategy to grow and evolve our core equities and bonds business. Today our range spans broad themes, such as disruption, to more narrow specialisms, such as food and water, digital infrastructure or smart manufacturing. Our Global Energy Transition strategy has enjoyed particularly strong demand. It was drawing attention and assets before last year’s energy crisis and that has continued unabated. It saw the largest net inflow of any of our thematic strategies in 2022. Our success is underpinned by the skill and vision of our portfolio managers and their access to data. Schroders’ early investment in data insights tools has paid dividends. We believe we have selected themes with great potential and are in high demand. Wherever there is demand, competition is strong. We relish the challenge. Our success rests on outperforming the market and our peers over the long term. We never forget that."

What is Schroders' approach to engagement with companies on sustainability issues?,"Schroders' approach to engagement involves three stages: dialogue for understanding long-term challenges, support and encouragement for companies to take action, and using their voice and rights as shareholders to support the changes they believe should be effected.

We are rightly proud of our long track record and of how we accelerated the impact of our work in recent years. The process is undertaken by our Active Ownership team and by hundreds of fund managers, investment and sustainability analysts around the world. Crucially, analysts and fund managers making investment decisions are central to engagement efforts, not a siloed team sitting in a corner. Our approach can be broken into three stages: 1. Dialogue – fact-finding engagements with companies to understand if and how they are preparing for the long-term challenges they face. 2. Engagement – we support companies to help them to understand the potential impact of these challenges and to encourage them to take action in the areas where change may be required. 3. Voting – we use our voice and rights as shareholders to support the changes we believe should be effected. We must be transparent, and so in 2022 we published our award-winning Engagement Blueprint. It means that our expectations are clear to companies and available to scrutiny by anyone. Experience has shown us that sustainability never stands still; new research will emerge, data sets will expand and regulation will change, and so we have committed to update our Blueprint on an annual basis. The table below offers a snapshot of our engagement in numbers. We report on this regularly. Our quarterly Sustainable Investment Report carries the numbers but also tells the stories of our engagements. Kim Lewis Head of Active Ownership"

The specifics of the targets set and the calculation methodology are as follows: • To achieve target vesting, a reduction of 7.5% in portfolio temperature score must be achieved by 2026, as measured by a four-quarter average. • The target range (threshold to maximum) has been set taking into account the anticipated trajectory to deliver our net zero ambitions. Maximum vesting requires a 10% reduction over a four-year period, which equates to us being broadly one year ahead of schedule in meeting the 2030 target. • The use of a four-quarter average reflects the importance of identifying and measuring an underlying trend in performance, and not letting market movements (which impact our portfolio balance on a month-by-month basis) inadvertently impact the outcome against this measure."

ZF addresses all three scopes of GHG emissions: Scope 1 includes direct emissions resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels in ZF’s own production and Scope 2 involves emissions from purchased energy, e.g., electricity and district heat. Scope 3 accounts for indirect emissions generated by purchased goods (“upstream”) and emissions generated by ZF products in the utilization phase (“downstream”). These emissions cannot be directly influenced by the Group. In addition to managing CO2 emissions, ZF is also tackling nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) which occur in smaller quantities than CO2 but which are much more harmful in the atmosphere. The core of ZF’s climate strategy is the commitment to reduce its corporate carbon footprint until 2030 by an absolute figure of 80% regarding Scope 1 and Scope 2 and by 40% relative to sales regarding Scope 3. Our ambition is to achieve net zero emissions in all three scopes by 2040. As for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, the climate strategy focuses on reduction and substitution. Energy efficiency and avoidance of energy consumption are the given priorities. A secondary focus is the transformation of energy consumption from fossil fuels to renewable sources, or a corresponding technology switch. Regarding Scope 3 emissions, the strategy focuses on improving product design, material selection, electrification and supply chain structures. To support target achievement, the Supervisory Board decided together with the Board of Management to link the reduction of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions as an indicator for the long-term incentive of ZF’s senior management from 2023 onwards. The Group’s target path towards climate neutrality is defined considering the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and in accordance with the requirements of the Paris Agreement."

Generally, share sensitivity, at the time of acquisition of these convertible bonds, is negligible but evolution of the markets may show residual share sensitivity."
What are the main specific risks associated with the use of Contingent Convertible bonds (CoCos)?,"The main specific risks associated with CoCos include the risk of triggering the loss absorption mechanism through equity conversion or write-down, the risk of non-payment of coupons, the risk of non-redemption on call dates, the risk related to the capital structure where CoCo holders are repaid after non-subordinated bond holders in case of bankruptcy, the valuation risk due to the complexity and lack of observable data, and the liquidity risk with potentially high trading ranges and difficulties finding trading counterparties during stress situations.","The main specific risks associated with the use of CoCos are the risks of: ■ Triggering the loss absorption mechanism: this involves either converting the CoCos into shares ('equity conversion') or a partial or total reduction of the nominal value ('write down'); ■ Non-payment of coupons: payment of coupons is at the discretion of the issuer (but with the automatic prior consent of the regulator) and non-payment of coupons does not constitute a default by the issuer; ■ Non-redemption on call date: AT 1 CoCos are perpetual bonds, but can be redeemed on certain dates (call dates) at the discretion of the issuer (with the agreement of its regulator). Non-repayment on the call date increases the maturity of the bond and therefore has a negative effect on the price of the bond. It also exposes the investor to the risk of never being repaid; ■ Capital structure: should the issuer go bankrupt, the CoCo holder will be repaid only after full repayment of non-subordinated bond holders. In some cases (e.g. CoCo with permanent write-down), the holder of the CoCo may suffer a greater loss than the shareholders. ■ Valuation: given the complexity of these instruments, their valuation for investment or subsequent investment requires specific expertise. The absence of regularly observable data on the issuer and the possibility of discretionary intervention by the issuer's regulatory authority may call into question the valuation of these instruments; ■ Liquidity: trading ranges can be high during stress situations. And in some scenarios, it may not be possible to find any trading counterparties."

This is reshaping clients’ expectations toward financial services firms, as their reference points are increasingly influenced by experiences with companies outside our sector, where technology-supported and data-driven solutions are progressively enabling a more personalized, relevant, on-time and seamless client experience. These services often focus on convenience, flexibility and personalization, and drive toward holistically addressing clients’ needs and facilitating community building. Therefore, our franchise needs to evolve, as clients measure us against new standards. While the global pandemic further sharpened our industry’s focus on digital-led solutions, recent geopolitical, macroeconomic and societal shifts have highlighted values such as security, stability and a credible plan toward a sustainable future. Additionally, many clients not only expect net-zero commitments from their financial services provider of choice, but they are also increasingly demanding investment, financing and advisory products and services that fit their own sustainability preferences and ambitions. Consolidation Many regions and businesses in the financial services sector are still highly fragmented. We expect further consolidation, with the key drivers being ongoing margin pressure, a push for cost efficiencies and increasing scale advantages resulting from fixed technology costs and regulatory requirements. Many players in financial services continue to seek increasing exposure and access to regions with attractive growth profiles, such as Asia and other emerging markets, through local acquisitions or partnerships, as well as acquiring new capabilities addressing changes in market dynamics and overall client demands. The increased focus on core capabilities and geographical footprint, as well as the ongoing simplification of business models to reduce operational and compliance risks, is likely to drive further disposals of non-core businesses and assets. While banks already face increasing challenges from digitalization needs and intensified competition, tightening macroeconomic conditions across major economies may create further pressure if a recessionary environment cannot be avoided.  30 Annual Report 2022 | Our strategy, business model and environment | Our environment 31New competitors Our competitive environment is evolving. In addition to traditional competitors in the asset-gathering businesses, new entrants are targeting selected parts of the value chain. However, we have not yet seen a fundamental unbundling of the value chain and client relationships, which might ultimately result in the further disintermediation of banks by new competitors. Over the long term, we believe large platform companies entering the financial services sector could pose a larger competitive threat, given their strong client franchises and access to client data, if they decide to broaden the scope of their services. While fintech firms have gained greater momentum during the COVID-19 pandemic, recent macroeconomic developments have slowed down the trend, as funding appetite and valuations have trended downward. Although we expect our industry to recover in the near term, we do not expect a material disruption of our asset-gathering businesses. The trend for forging partnerships between new entrants and incumbent banks is continuing, as technology and innovation help banks overcome new challenges. Regulation In 2022, regulators further progressed in their policy developments with a focus on regulations around digital innovation and sustainable finance along with finalizing and implementing the remaining Basel III requirements. Regulators increased their focus on AI, data and, particularly, digital assets, as a result of market turbulence. In the area of digital assets, the attention by regulators was on stablecoins, crypto assets and the prudential treatment of banks’ exposures to digital assets, with recent efforts by supranational standard setters aiming to coordinate relevant national regulations. Central banks also continued to work on central bank digital currencies, which aim to provide new digital payment instruments that would be a direct liability of the central bank. Sustainable finance and climate-related risks continued to be a key focus of policymakers in 2022, where we noted significant activity, particularly in the areas of disclosures regarding the impact of climate-related risks and corporate sustainability"

What are some of the regulatory requirements and challenges faced by UBS as an internationally active bank?,"UBS faces stringent capital and total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) requirements, as well as the need to transfer significant operations into subsidiaries to improve resolvability, which results in increased implementation, capital, and funding costs and reduced operational flexibility. Additionally, UBS must comply with local capital, liquidity, stable funding, capital planning, and stress testing requirements in various jurisdictions.

Furthermore, UBS is preparing for the implementation of additional capital standards from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which could limit strategic opportunities or capital returns to shareholders. The wealth and asset management businesses also face increasing regulatory scrutiny and changing standards, including the SEC Regulation Best Interest, the Volcker Rule, and changes in European and Swiss market conduct regulation, which may lead to further business changes and expenses.","As an internationally active Swiss systemically relevant bank (an SRB), we are subject to capital and total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) requirements that are among the most stringent in the world. Moreover, many of our subsidiaries must comply with minimum capital, liquidity and similar requirements and, as a result, UBS Group AG and UBS AG have contributed a significant portion of their capital and provide substantial liquidity to these subsidiaries. These funds are available to meet funding and collateral needs in the relevant entities, but are generally not readily available for use by the Group as a whole. We expect our risk-weighted assets (RWA) to further increase as the effective date for additional capital standards promulgated by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the BCBS) draws nearer. Increases in capital and liquidity standards could significantly curtail our ability to pursue strategic opportunities or to return capital to shareholders. Our wealth and asset management businesses operate in an environment of increasing regulatory scrutiny and changing standards with respect to fiduciary and other standards of care and the focus on mitigating or eliminating conflicts of interest between a manager or advisor and the client, which require effective implementation across the global systems and processes of investment managers and other industry participants."
